The index.html is the main file which directly links to the home page. This file consists of basic HTML. 

JS file (script.js) consists of an event listener for submit events which contains the addTodo() function. addTodo() function makes a ‘li’ and adds it to ‘ul’. updateLS() function updates the list. And this list is stored in the local storage by JSON.stringify. And whenever a user reopens the website, previous data is accessed by using JSON.parse.
